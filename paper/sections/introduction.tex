\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Knowledge graphs (KGs) organise scientific knowledge as typed, directed
multigraphs: entities represent concepts (e.g.\ \emph{photon},
\emph{eigenvalue}, \emph{graphene}) and edges encode semantic relations such as
\texttt{derives}, \texttt{explains}, or \texttt{contradicts}
\citep{ji2021kgsurvey}.  Despite decades of curation, scientific KGs remain
structurally incomplete---missing edges that encode latent theoretical
connections and missing entities that represent undiscovered concepts.

Knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods---TransE \citep{bordes2013transe},
DistMult \citep{yang2015distmult}, RotatE \citep{sun2019rotate}---learn
low-dimensional embeddings and predict missing links.  However, they operate at
the \emph{triple} level: each predicted link is an isolated statistical
extrapolation without theoretical justification.  They do not produce
\emph{theory-level propositions} that articulate \emph{why} a relation should
hold, what it implies, or how it could be falsified.

We address this gap with \textbf{Harmony}, a framework for automated theory
discovery in scientific KGs.  The key idea is a composite quality metric---the
\emph{Harmony score}---that captures four desiderata of a well-structured
knowledge graph:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item \textbf{Compressibility}: the KG's edge-type distribution and spanning
    structure admit a short description (MDL proxy).
  \item \textbf{Coherence}: closed paths exhibit consistent edge-type semantics
    and contradictions are sparse.
  \item \textbf{Symmetry}: entities of the same type use edge types in similar
    proportions (low Jensen--Shannon divergence).
  \item \textbf{Generativity}: a shallow DistMult model can recover masked edges,
    indicating learnable relational patterns.
\end{enumerate}

A large language model (LLM) proposes candidate mutations---adding edges or
entities---each accompanied by a natural-language claim, justification, and
falsification condition.  Proposals are validated, scored by the Harmony gain
they produce, and archived in a MAP-Elites \citep{mouret2015mapelites}
quality-diversity grid.  An island-model \citep{whitley1997island} search with
four islands, each assigned an exploration strategy from a cyclic schedule of
refinement, combination, and novelty (with refinement appearing twice), runs
concurrently with periodic migration to balance exploitation and exploration.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item A four-component \textbf{Harmony metric} for scoring KG quality that
    is domain-agnostic, bounded in $[0,1]$, and decomposes into interpretable
    sub-scores (Section~\ref{sec:metric}).
  \item A \textbf{proposal schema} that elevates KG mutations from bare triples
    to falsifiable theory-level claims (Section~\ref{sec:proposals}).
  \item An \textbf{island-model LLM search loop} with MAP-Elites archiving and
    stagnation-triggered constrained prompting (Section~\ref{sec:search}).
  \item Empirical evaluation on \textbf{five KG domains}---linear algebra,
    periodic table, astronomy, physics, and materials science---showing that
    Harmony-guided proposals outperform frequency and random baselines on
    Hits@10, with expert plausibility scores~$\geq 3.0$ (Section~\ref{sec:results}).
\end{enumerate}
