\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented Harmony, a framework for automated theory discovery in scientific
knowledge graphs.  The four-component Harmony metric---compressibility,
coherence, symmetry, and generativity---provides a principled, domain-agnostic
quality signal for scoring KG mutations.  An LLM proposer generates structured,
falsifiable theory-level claims, which are validated and archived in a MAP-Elites
quality-diversity grid across an island-model search topology.

Calibration experiments confirm 31--65\% improvements over frequency baselines on
two domains.  Discovery experiments on astronomy, physics, and materials science
KGs show consistent Hits@10 gains over a standalone DistMult baseline, with
expert plausibility scores meeting the pre-registered $\geq 3.0$ threshold.

Future work includes scaling to larger scientific KGs (e.g.\ domain-specific
subsets of Wikidata), extending the relation type vocabulary, integrating
literature-retrieval-based plausibility scoring, and exploring multi-LLM
ensembles across islands for improved diversity.
