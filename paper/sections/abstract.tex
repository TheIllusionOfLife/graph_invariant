We introduce an open-source framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to
discover closed-form, interpretable compositions of graph features/invariants through island-model
evolutionary search. Discovering compact formulas that predict structural graph
properties---such as average shortest-path length or algebraic
connectivity---remains challenging because the space of symbolic expressions is
vast and existing approaches sacrifice interpretability for accuracy. Our system
addresses this by orchestrating four islands with distinct prompt strategies
(refinement, combination, novelty) and temperature schedules, augmented with a
MAP-Elites quality-diversity archive that maintains behaviorally diverse
candidates along simplicity and novelty axes. Candidates are evaluated in a
sandboxed execution environment with static analysis guards, scored by a
composite objective combining Spearman correlation, formula simplicity, and
novelty relative to known invariants, and subjected to an LLM-driven
self-correction loop that repairs failing candidates. We evaluate on synthetic
graph datasets spanning five generative families (Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi,
Barab\'{a}si--Albert, Watts--Strogatz, random geometric, stochastic block
model), with out-of-distribution validation on large-scale and extreme-topology
graphs. Across four experiment configurations---correlation-mode ASPL with
MAP-Elites, algebraic connectivity, upper-bound ASPL, and a multi-seed
benchmark---our LLM-discovered formulas achieve strong validation Spearman correlations
and remain interpretable while trailing the strongest PySR/linear baselines in the
current ASPL setting
(test Spearman $\rho = 0.947$ for MAP-Elites ASPL; $\rho = 0.921 \pm 0.027$
across 5 benchmark seeds) while producing interpretable expressions amenable
to mathematical analysis.
